# Azeotropic optimization for a vapor-liquid mixture using Matlab
In this project, the aim was to identify whether the vapor-liquid mixture contained an azeotrope. Both the species of vapor and liquid were not known, but their physical properties were available for computation. The dataset that related temperature to the composition of both vapor and liquid were tabulated below.
